# Instant Gratification: Magnet, Let me get that

> "If you can see it, you should have it."

The "Walk of Shame" (walking 5 blocks to pick up a block you just mined) is a cardinal sin of flow state. **Magnet, Let me get that!** is not a utility; it's an extension of the player's will.

An intrinsic, zero-setup item vacuum for the modern player. Fast, aggressive, and ignores physical barriers.

## Features

- **Vacuum Field**: items fly to you instantly.
- **Phase Shifting**: Items clip through walls to reach you. No getting stuck.
- **Velocity Injection**: Non-linear acceleration for a snappy feel.
- **XP Sync**: Experience orbs obey the same laws.
